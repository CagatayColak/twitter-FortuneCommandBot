# Fortune Bot

  Fortune Bot is a Python-based Twitter bot that executes the 'fortune' command on the terminal and tweets its output on Twitter. This bot is built using the Tweepy library for Twitter API access and subprocess module for executing terminal commands.

## Prerequisites

  Before running the bot, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* Python 3.x
* Tweepy library (pip install tweepy)

## Getting Started
  To run the bot, simply clone the repository and run the fortune_bot.py file. Before running the bot, make sure to set up your Twitter API keys in the keys.py file. By default, the bot will execute the 'fortune' command and tweet its output. If you want to customize the command, you can modify the cmd variable in the terminal() function.

## Acknowledgments
